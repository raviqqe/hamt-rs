HAMT implementation whose sub-trees can be shared over threads.

[Hash-Array Mapped Trie (HAMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie)
is a data structure popular as a map (a.k.a. associative array or dictionary)
or set.
Its immutable variant is adopted widely by functional programming languages
like Scala and Clojure to implement immutable and memory-efficient associative
arrays and sets.

## Technical notes

The implementation normalizes tree structures of HAMTs by eliminating
intermediate nodes during delete operations as described
in [the CHAMP paper][champ].
